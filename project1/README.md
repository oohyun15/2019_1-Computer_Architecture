# Project 1. MIPS Assembler
This project is to implement a MIPS ISA assembler and a given code is a basic skeleton for input and output.

## Instructions
Baiscally, the code written in `assembler.c` operates only creation of file for input and output.
Each student requires to implement parsing, converting or any functions based on the skeleton code.
The detailed instructions are desribed in `handout/Project_1.pdf`.

There are two directories for this project. The code will read a `.s` file from `sample_input` and it will produce `.o` file in same directory. 

The files in `sample_output` are used when you test your output with them.
The following is an example of command for the skeleton code:

```shell
# Usage
$ ./assembler sample_input/example1.s   # This will produce sample_input/example1.o

# Test
$ make test # This will test all examples in sample_output
```

## Q & A
If you find any errors in this code or have a question, please leave it on AjouBB.
